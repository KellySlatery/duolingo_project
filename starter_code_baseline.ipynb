    "Goal: Using data from the [2018 Duolingo Shared Task Challenge on Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM)](#https://sharedtask.duolingo.com/2018.html), extract a common order of acquisition for morphosyntactical features of Spanish amongst users using the English platform to learn Spanish. Morphosyntacic features are parts of word that actually give grammatical information, such as the plural -s or different types of conjugations in Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at data from English speakers learnign Spanish for three major reasons:\n",
    "- The U.S. has one of the highest populations of monolinguals in the world.\n",
    "- Foreign language education in the U.S. is subpar and needs reform based on research.\n",
    "- Spanish is increasingly important in the U.S. as the U.S. Spanish-speaking population grows and generations continue to learn and use Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The applications and utility of discovering and supporting a data-informed order of acquisiton for morphosyntactic festures of Spanish are two-fold. First, understanding the natural order in which students acquire different features of Spanish can help those who write Spanish textbooks and Spanish teachers alike structure their lessons in a way more conducive to learning. Second, understanding this natural order can positively impact motivation in Spanish-learning by adjusting both teachers' and students' expectations for student learning to hopefully increase effectiveness of error correction and student self-esteem.

    "First, the data needs to be compiled into a DataFrame for easier analysis and filtered to only those sessions where the format is 'reverse_translate' and the session is either 'lesson' or 'practice'. This will most likely require AWS, SQL, or perhaps just cutting down on the data used. Next, as the basis for the classification models, we will label a certain subset of the train data prompt tokens for which possible errors can be made (Ex. {1: plural, 2: ser vs estar, 3: regular past tense, 4: irregular past tense, ...}). Using these generated labels, we can build a model to generate labels for the remaining millions of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will consist of three models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a classification model, most likely an ensemble decision tree (random forest, bagged classfier, extra trees), create a label for what error a user made in each prompt. This will mainly be based on the column labeling error/no error [0,1] and the accompanying word (tokens) and its details (Ex. {1: plural, 2: ser vs estar, 3: regular past tense, 4: irregular past tense, ...}). Then, to identify which errors are most common across the board on each prompt, we will sort the data by prompt and find the value counts for the labeled error column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using another classification model, most likely an ensemble decision tree (random forest, bagged classfier, extra trees), create a label for what errors are possible, given a prompt. This will be based mainly on what words (tokens) are present in the prompt and their token details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a neural network, predict based on the features available, like days and time, along with a new calculation of whether or not the user made the morphosyntactic error labeled (combining above possible error label, with typo of error label, and provided [0,1] label, where 1 indicates that the student made an error), predict, given the next prompt, whether or not the student will make the possible morphosyntactic mistake.\n"

For the classificaiton models, we will be labeling data manually and then using a model to label further data. For the third model, given that there is a development and test dataset, we will be testing our model predictions of errors on labeled data (supervised learning) and evaluating success based on accuracy of these predictions, which works with AUC and F1. \n",

   "source": [
    "Risks / Perceived Challenges:\n",
    "- The dataset is quite robust with over 2 million tokens from over 6,000 users worldwide. It is impossible to analyze all of this data the way we've been doing in class, so it will be necessary to either cut down the data or upload it to AWS and figure out how AWS connects to jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- The data is not yet in a DataFrame and I am only comfortable as of yet performing data analysis on pandas DataFrames. Because the data seems to be compatible with a database-style organization, SQL might be helpful. I like using SQL, but I have no idea how to integrate it into what I'm doing or build a database from the data.\n",
    "- I may only be able to finish the first model of classifying error types by graduation day. Though I could finish it later, the first model is only a stepping stone, and may not be as interesting or as helpful to my audience (classmates, employers, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- This data does not provide the student response. Rather, it provides an indication of on which tokens in the user-provided translation the user made an error. Thus, we have to assume that the user's mistake was, in fact, morphosyntactic if the error was made on a word that should contain one of the morphosyntactic qualities we are looking for (and labeled [0,1,...,n]). \n",
    "- In labeling morphosyntactic error types, I will have to assume different groups of error types with being aware of their representation in the dataset. I will base these error labels on previous research on the order of acquisition for Spanish morphosyntactice features, but perhaps it is this grouping that needs to be reanalyzed in future studies of order of acquisition.\n",
    "- Lessons are often based on only one morphosyntactic feature at a time, so this will need to be taken into account in our models. It may make sense to compare only practice sessions errors, rather than lesson errors. On the other hand, previously learned morphosyntactice features are most likely included in future lesson prompts as well, so it may not make a huge difference, except that we need to compare errors by feature over time rather than errors at a time amongst features."
